# River Pollutant Dispersion Model (3D)

An interactive **Streamlit-based scientific visualization tool** for simulating and exploring the **3D advection–dispersion of pollutants in a river channel**.  
Designed by Subodh Purohit for **educational, teaching, and demonstration purposes** in Environmental Engineering.

---

## 📌 Overview

This application numerically and analytically solves the **Advection–Dispersion Equation (ADE)** to visualize how a pollutant cloud evolves over **space and time** in a river under different flow and dispersion conditions.

It supports both:
- **Instantaneous releases (Gaussian Puff)**  
- **Continuous discharges (Gaussian Plume via superposition)**

The app emphasizes **physical intuition**, **interactive learning**, and **high-quality 3D visualization**.
